                    <h2 class="text-center mb-4">A Strange Arrival</h2>
                    <p>The night was silent, except for the scratching of a pen against paper. Neorock, a 13-year-old boy, sat at his desk, flipping through the pages of his textbook. The dim glow of the study lamp cast shadows around his small room.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly, a deep humming sound filled the air, making the walls tremble. Neorock's pen slipped from his fingers. The air around him grew heavy as a shimmering blue portal ripped open in the middle of the room.</p>
                    <p>Neorock stumbled backward, his heart pounding. From the swirling energy, a tall figure emerged, draped in a flowing black cape. His silver eyes gleamed under the hood, his presence radiating power.</p>
                    <p>Neorock froze. His body screamed at him to run, but he forced himself to speak.</p>
                    <p>"W-Who are you?!" he stammered.</p>
                    <p>The figure took a step forward, his voice calm but commanding.</p>
                    <p>"I am Phantom. I have come from another universe to find you."</p>
                    <p>Neorock's mind spun. "Another… universe?"</p>
                    <p>Phantom nodded. "Yes. Your world, Earth, is part of the Milky Way in this multiverse. But I come from a different universe, one from the Nexus Universe."</p>
                    <p>Neorock narrowed his eyes, still unsure whether to trust this stranger. "What do you want from me?"</p>
                    <p>Phantom took a deep breath. "I have come to take you to Herlek, a planet in my universe. There is no time to explain everything here. The demon lord Arengoth is taking over the multiverse, and the Milky Way is next. You must come with me."</p>
                    <p>Neorock's chest tightened. "Wait… taking over? You mean Earth is in danger?"</p>
                    <p>Phantom's gaze darkened. "Not just in danger. Earth and the entire Milky Way are already under attack. You may not have seen it yet, but I can hear them. The demons have arrived."</p>
                    <p>Just as Phantom finished speaking, the ground shook violently. A low, monstrous growl echoed from outside.</p>
                    <p>Neorock's breathing grew uneven. This couldn't be real. This had to be a dream, right?</p>
                    <p>Phantom extended his hand. "Neorock, you must choose now. Stay here and be consumed by darkness, or come with me and fight for the multiverse."</p>
                    <p>Neorock clenched his fists. His heart told him the choice was already made.</p>
                    <p>"I'll go with you," he said firmly.</p>
                    <p>Phantom gave a single nod. "Then let's go."</p>

                    <h2 class="text-center mb-4">The Multiverse Gateway</h2>
                    <p>The swirling energy of the portal surrounded them, and in a flash, they landed on a massive floating platform.</p>
                    <p>Neorock gasped as he took in the sight—endless portals, each one leading to a different universe. Above each portal, a glowing nameplate displayed the universe's name. Below the names, floating screens showed the date, time, year, and planet selector.</p>
                    <p>"Where are we?" Neorock asked.</p>
                    <p>"This is the Multiverse Gateway," Phantom explained. "It is the center of the multiverse. Every universe is connected through this place."</p>
                    <p>Neorock noticed Phantom walking toward a particular portal. It was marked:</p>
                    <p class="text-center font-bold">NEXUS UNIVERSE</p>
                    <p class="text-center font-bold">Planet: Herlek</p>
                    <p>Phantom adjusted the settings to Herlek, and without hesitation, they stepped inside.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Arrival at Herlek</h2>
                    <p>The air around them shimmered, and within seconds, they emerged onto a vast futuristic world.</p>
                    <p>Neorock's mouth fell open. The city before him was breathtaking—tall, sleek buildings lined with glowing blue circuits, hovering vehicles moving smoothly in the sky, and lush green forests mixed with modern technology. Rivers glowed with an ethereal light, and mountains stood tall, their peaks touching the sky.</p>
                    <p>"This is… incredible," Neorock whispered.</p>
                    <p>Phantom's face remained serious. "Yes, but Herlek was not always like this."</p>
                    <p>Neorock turned to him. "What do you mean?"</p>
                    <p>Phantom let out a deep breath.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-center mb-4">The Fall of the Multiverse</h2>
                    <p>"Many years ago, the multiverse was peaceful. The Nexus Universe was its center, and Herlek was the most advanced planet of all. Our people had technology beyond your imagination, but we also lived in harmony with nature.</p>
                    <p>But then… the darkness came."</p>
                    <p>Neorock stiffened. "Darkness?"</p>
                    <p>Phantom nodded. "The demon lord Arengoth. His army rose from the depths of the multiverse, conquering one universe after another. We fought back, but it was not enough.</p>
                    <p>Our Nexus Universe controlled the multiverse, except for one universe—Parlent. That was already a land of demons. It became their base, their stronghold. And from there, they attacked."</p>
                    <p>Neorock swallowed hard. "And you lost?"</p>
                    <p>Phantom clenched his fists. "We lost everything. Herlek fell. Its people were wiped out."</p>
                    <p>Neorock stared at the ground. "But if Herlek was destroyed, then how is this city here?"</p>
                    <p>Phantom's silver eyes softened. "Because me and my friend Vault survived. We rebuilt what we could. But Herlek is not truly safe. The only thing keeping the demons out is the energy shield around this city."</p>
                    <p>Neorock's mind was spinning. So much information… and yet, something still didn't make sense.</p>
                    <p>He looked up at Phantom. "Then why did you come for me?"</p>
                    <p>Phantom placed a hand on Neorock's shoulder.</p>
                    <p>"Because, Neorock… you are the last hope of the multiverse."</p>

                    <h2 class="text-center mb-4">The Truth about Earth</h2>
                    <p>Neorock's chest tightened. "You keep saying that the Milky Way is in danger… but Earth still looks normal."</p>
                    <p>Phantom's face turned grim.</p>
                    <p>"You don't understand. The Milky Way is already lost."</p>
                    <p>Neorock's blood ran cold. "What?"</p>
                    <p>Phantom turned to the sky, his eyes filled with sorrow. "The shaking you felt in your room, the strange voices you heard… that was the moment the demons arrived."</p>
                    <p>Neorock's heart pounded. "But that means—"</p>
                    <p>Phantom nodded. "Earth, your home… is already in Arengoth's hands. The people may not realize it yet, but the invasion has begun. If we do nothing, Earth will be completely consumed by darkness, but we can't do anything, we don't have that much power."</p>
                    <p>Neorock felt his entire world shatter. His home… his family… everything was already lost?</p>
                    <p>Phantom knelt beside him. "But you, Neorock, still have a chance to fight. If you train, if you grow strong… you can save them. You can save the multiverse, and Arengoth will not kill your family and other people but will make them as his worker or will keep them in prisons."</p>
                    <p>Neorock clenched his fists.</p>
                    <p>He was no hero. He was just a kid.</p>
                    <p>But if Earth was truly in danger… he couldn't just sit back and do nothing.</p>
                    <p>Taking a deep breath, Neorock looked Phantom straight in the eye.</p>
                    <p>"I'll do it. Train me."</p>
                    <p>Phantom gave a small smile. "Then welcome to Herlek, Neorock. Your journey begins now."</p>
                    <p>Just as Neorock was trying to process everything, a new figure approached. He was tall and wore a long dark-blue coat with silver linings. His sharp eyes studied Neorock before he smirked.</p>
                    <p>"So, this is the kid you brought, Phantom?" the man said.</p>
                    <p>Phantom nodded. "Neorock, this is Vault. He is my closest ally and one of the last survivors of Herlek."</p>
                    <p>Vault crossed his arms. "If you're going to survive here, kid, you need proper training. And that's where I come in."</p>
                    <p>Neorock hesitated. "You're going to train me?"</p>
                    <p>Vault grinned. "That's right. Your training will last ten years. If you want to fight against Arengoth, you'll need to master your abilities first."</p>
                    <p>Neorock felt a lump in his throat. Ten years… That was longer than he had imagined. But he had already made his decision.</p>
                    <p>"I'm ready," he said.</p>
                    <p>Vault chuckled. "Good. Then let's begin."</p>

                    <h2 class="text-center mb-4">A Teacher Like No Other</h2>
                    <p>Vault led Neorock through the futuristic city, past towering skyscrapers and glowing energy fields. As they walked, Vault spoke, his tone both serious and amused.</p>
                    <p>"You probably think training means swinging a sword and throwing punches, right?" he asked.</p>
                    <p>Neorock shrugged. "Isn't that how warriors train?"</p>
                    <p>Vault chuckled. "That's part of it. But before you can fight, you need to understand <b>what you're fighting for</b>. Power without purpose is just destruction."</p>
                    <p>Neorock frowned. "Then what am I supposed to do?"</p>
                    <p>Vault smirked. "First, we talk. You need knowledge before you need strength."</p>

                    <h2 class="text-center mb-4">The Weight of the Multiverse</h2>
                    <p>Over the next few days, Vault and Neorock had long conversations. They spoke of the history of the Nexus Universe, the rise of Arengoth, and the countless worlds that had already fallen. Vault described battles so intense that entire planets were erased from existence.</p>
                    <p>"Arengoth doesn't just conquer," Vault explained. "He <b>corrupts</b>. When he takes over a world, he doesn't just rule it—he turns its people into his soldiers. That's why fighting him isn't just about strength. It's about resisting his influence."</p>
                    <p>Neorock listened carefully, realizing that this war wasn't just about saving Earth. It was about <b>saving the very fabric of reality itself</b>.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-center mb-4">A Decade of Training</h2>
                    <p>On the third day, Vault took Neorock to a massive training hall. The walls were lined with ancient weapons, energy-infused armor, and technology beyond Earth's imagination.</p>
                    <p>"Your training begins now," Vault said, tossing Neorock a small, metallic device.</p>
                    <p>Neorock examined it. "What is this?"</p>
                    <p>Vault grinned. "A battle core. It enhances your strength, but only if you can control it. <b>Ten years from now, you'll be a warrior. But first, let's see if you can survive a single day.</b>"</p>
                    <p>Neorock took a deep breath and clenched his fists. <b>This was just the beginning.</b></p>

                    <p>Neorock and Phantom arrived at the vast training grounds of Herlek. The air buzzed with energy, and the ground beneath them shimmered with embedded circuits, reflecting the sky above. Vault stood before them, holding a thick scroll in his hands.</p>
                    <p>"Here, kid," Vault said, handing the scroll to Neorock. "This is your training timetable. Follow it strictly, or you won't survive."</p>
                    <p>Neorock unrolled it and felt his breath hitch. The schedule was brutal:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 my-4 space-y-2">

                    </ul>
                    <p>Neorock gulped. "This... this is insane."</p>
                    <p>Vault smirked. "This is survival. If you want to stand a chance against Arengoth, you'll follow every second of it."</p>
                    <p>Neorock clenched his fists and nodded. "I'll do it."</p>

                    <h2 class="text-center mb-4">The Multiverse's Past</h2>
                    <p>As they sat down later, Vault began explaining the history of the multiverse.</p>
                    <p>"Long ago, Nexus was the heart of the multiverse. Our people lived in harmony, alongside mighty heroes and the great King Falcon. But then, the war began."</p>
                    <p>Neorock listened intently.</p>
                    <p>"Arengoth's demon army ravaged universe after universe. The heroes fought, but one by one, they fell. Some were slain, others imprisoned. Now, all that remains are the last few survivors… and you, the chosen one."</p>
                    <p>Neorock took a deep breath. "So, I have to become strong enough to defeat them?"</p>
                    <p>Vault nodded. "Not just defeat them—bring balance back to the multiverse."</p>
                    <p>Unbeknownst to them, Phantom had quietly left Herlek without a word.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Phantom's Journey to Karlos</h2>
                    <p>Phantom stepped through the glowing portal, arriving at <b>Universe Karlos, Planet Parnet</b>. The land was dark, with crimson skies and burning mountains. The air was thick with the scent of sulfur.</p>
                    <p>A shadowy figure stepped forward—<b>Arestchin, a powerful demon</b>.</p>
                    <p>"You came," Arestchin said with a smirk.</p>
                    <p>Phantom's silver eyes hardened. "Why did you call me?"</p>
                    <p>Arestchin folded his arms. "You know the history. You know our relationship. I'll say it again—join the demon army. Join us."</p>
                    <p>Phantom's voice was firm. "No. You're my brother, Arestchin, but I stand with the light, not darkness. Even if it means fighting you."</p>
                    <p>Arestchin's smirk vanished. "So be it. Be ready to die."</p>

                    <h2 class="text-center mb-4">A Battle between Brothers</h2>
                    <p>Arestchin attacked first, summoning dark tendrils that lashed toward Phantom. Phantom dodged, countering with a burst of energy, but he was quickly overwhelmed. The power difference was clear.</p>
                    <p>"You're weak," Arestchin sneered. "Accept the darkness!"</p>
                    <p>Phantom gasped for breath. As Arestchin charged up his ultimate attack—a dark sphere of destruction—a sudden fireball shot through the air, striking Arestchin and throwing him backward.</p>
                    <p>Phantom looked up to see Neorock and Vault standing at the portal.</p>
                    <p>"You didn't think we'd let you fight alone, did you?" Vault smirked.</p>
                    <p>Together, the three warriors clashed against Arestchin. After an intense battle, they managed to subdue him, sealing him in an unbreakable prison.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-center mb-4">The Truth about Phantom's Past</h2>
                    <p>After the battle, the three sat in silence, recovering. Vault broke it first. "I saw the arrow that called Phantom here. That's how we knew."</p>
                    <p>Phantom sighed. "Arestchin is my brother."</p>
                    <p>Neorock and Vault stared in shock.</p>
                    <p>"Years ago, a tornado struck our city. It tore everything apart, and Arestchin and I were separated. For years, I searched for him… and when I finally found him, he had already become a demon."</p>
                    <p>Neorock exhaled. "So, today was the first time you met since then?"</p>
                    <p>Phantom nodded. "Yes. And now… he is in prison."</p>
                    <p>The group fell into deep thought. The battle was far from over. The journey had only just begun.</p>

                    <p>"Training isn't about learning how to fight," Vault began, his voice steady. "It's about learning how to survive."</p>

                    <p>With a flick of his wrist, Vault activated a battle simulation chamber, and the world around them changed. The ground beneath Neorock's feet cracked as a shadowy figure emerged, glowing red eyes piercing through the darkness.</p>

                    <p>Phantom, Vault, and Akio sat in the dark, damp prison cell, their minds racing with desperation. They knew that someone within Neorock's team was a traitor, and if they didn't warn him soon, it could lead to disaster. Phantom gritted his teeth, his sharp mind running through possible ways to get the message out. "We have to send him a letter," Phantom whispered. "A direct message—short and urgent. If we fail, Neorock will be walking into a trap."</p>
                    <p>Akio nodded and quickly tore a piece of cloth from his already tattered shirt. Dipping his fingers into a small puddle of black ink left by the careless guards, he scribbled the warning: "Someone is betraying you, Neorock ~ Phantom."</p>

                    <p>The day after Waegoes's murder, the team was tense and anxious. Mayura's suspicion about Shashmaag was growing stronger. Neorock decided they needed to focus on training, but the unresolved mystery hung over them like a storm.</p>
                    <p>Neorock and Master Shingkun designed a new training regimen focused on mental resilience and combat efficiency. The soldiers engaged in rigorous physical exercises, endurance runs through treacherous terrains, and combat simulations designed to mimic the chaos of battle. Neorock's sessions with Soultear became more intense, with Shingkun pushing him through meditative combat drills and spiritual synchronization exercises.</p>

                    <p>The battle on Xarvion had left the team scarred and weary. Though they had triumphed over Zaelthar, the wounds of war ran deep, and the loss of Torgan weighed heavily on their spirits. His sacrifice had not been in vain, but it was a grim reminder that every battle took its toll.</p>
                    <p>Back at their base, Neorock gathered the team to strategize. "Gaeth's forces are relentless. We can't afford to be reactive. We must take the fight to them before they overwhelm us."</p>
                    <p>Mayura, still grappling with her growing suspicions of Shashmaag, continued her secret surveillance. With Nova's assistance, she managed to tap into the security feeds, tracking his movements.</p>

                    <p>Back at their base, Mayura and Nova continued their covert surveillance of Shashmaag. His movements were carefully calculated, his words precise, and yet, something felt inherently wrong. Mayura had intercepted a transmission—a coded message sent to an unknown location. It was brief, but the implications were dire.</p>
                    <p>"He's communicating with someone outside of our network," Mayura whispered to Nova. "And I have a strong feeling about who it might be."</p>

With Shashmaag's betrayal now almost certain, Mayura and Nova increased their surveillance efforts, determined to catch him in the act. The tension among the team was palpable; trust was wavering, and the war against Gaeth was only growing fiercer.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, another challenge loomed. A new message from Gaeth's forces arrived, as expected—a challenge delivered by Verathos, a demon wielding the power of thunder and storms.

A new demon general had emerged—Maldrak, the Executioner, known for his brutal efficiency and mastery of war tactics. His message was simple: "Face me on the battlefield of Xelthar, or I will bring ruin to your allies."</p>
                    <p>Xelthar was a wasteland of shattered bones and cursed remnants of past battles, a graveyard of warriors long forgotten. With no choice but to engage, Neorock and his team prepared for yet another deadly confrontation.</p>

                    <p>Neorock turned to Shashmaag. "You will remain here on the planet and be ready when we need reinforcements."</p>
                    <p>Shashmaag nodded with a subtle smirk, unnoticed by most. But Mayura caught it, her suspicions growing stronger.</p>

Shashmaag's betrayal had shaken the warriors to their core, but his treachery had been answered with steel and fire. Neorock's forces had emerged victorious, yet the cost had been steep—Akio's sacrifice, the blood of countless allies spilled across the stars. But there was no time to grieve. War did not wait for mourning.</p>
                    <p>The moment of respite was brief. Traegoth, father of Lapras and Kulharis, had arrived. His voice boomed through the war-torn remains of the battlefield, his towering form dark against the infernal skies.</p>

Gaeth had fallen, but his final words still echoed in Neorock's mind: "This is my end, but not the end of darkness." It was a warning, a promise that something even more sinister was yet to come. The team had no time to celebrate. The battle against the forces of darkness was not over. Selavis, the Devourer of Worlds, remained—a nightmare beyond imagination.</p>
                    <p>After Gaeth's fall, the warriors needed time to recover. Wounds were treated, armor was reforged, and strategies were discussed. The atmosphere was heavy with both grief and determination. Akio's sacrifice still haunted Velora, and Nova struggled with the weight of the lives she had taken.
